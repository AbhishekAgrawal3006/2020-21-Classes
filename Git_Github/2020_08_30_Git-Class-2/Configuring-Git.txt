Common commands for configuring git are - 

    1. git config --global user.name "[user name]" - Sets the name you want attached to 
                                                     your commit transactions.

    2. git config --global user.email "[user email]" - Sets the email you want attached
                                                       to your commit transactions.

    3. git config --global color.ui auto - Enables helpful colorization of command line 
                                           output.

    4. git config --global http.proxy "http://edcguest:edcguest@172.31.100.14:3128"

    5. git config --global https.proxy "https://edcguest:edcguest@172.31.100.14:3128"

    Last two commands are used for configuring git to be used over proxy. You may change
    the proxy values accordingly.

Note: These command are used for configuring git and are not needed to be executed 
every time an empty git repository is initialized.
